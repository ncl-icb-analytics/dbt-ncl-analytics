# Note on Dependabot alerts (2026-02-04):
# - deepdiff (CRITICAL): Blocked by dbt-common<8.0 pin, requires dbt 1.10+ to fix
# - protobuf (HIGH): Blocked by snowflake-snowpark-python<6 pin
# - wheel (HIGH): Transitive dep, pip install --upgrade wheel separately if needed
# These are low practical risk for dbt analytics use cases (no untrusted input processing)
