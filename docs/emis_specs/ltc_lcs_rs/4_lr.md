## What this search does

Start with the patients found by "GROUP4- LR" (see below). This report has no filtering rules of its own — it reports on its starting population.

## Who we start with

1. **LTC LCS Base*** — Start with currently registered patients. Include patients who match Patients included in search LTC LCS: AF Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: CKD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: CHD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Diabetes Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Hypertension Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: NAFLD Register v2* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Asthma Adult Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Asthma CYP Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: COPD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: HF Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: PAD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Stroke/TIA Register*.
2. **LTC LCS MOC Base excluding CYP only, LR HTN only, LR Adult Asthma only** — Start with the patients found by "LTC LCS Base*". Finally include patients who do not match Patients included in search LTC LCS: Asthma CYP Register ONLY OR patients included in search On Asthma Adult Register ONLY- LTC LCS Priority Group 4 (LR Asthma Adult only) OR patients included in search On Hypertension Register ONLY- LTC LCS Priority Group 4 (LR HTN only).
3. **GROUP4- LR** — Start with the patients found by "LTC LCS MOC Base excluding CYP only, LR HTN only, LR Adult Asthma only". Finally include patients who do not match Patients included in search GROUP1- HRC OR patients included in search GROUP2- HR OR patients included in search GROUP3- MR.
4. **This search** then applies the rules below to that population.

## Inclusion logic, step by step

No rules — all patients from the starting population are included.

## Report output

These define what the report shows for each patient, not who is included.

### Patient Details

### Record of Interpreter Information
- **Clinical Codes** (clinical events)
  - Code in: `4lr_vs1` (16 codes)

## Code lists used

Names below match `valueset_friendly_name` in the extraction CSVs. The hash identifies the exact code list content, so a changed hash means the codes changed.

| Search | Code list | Cluster | System | Codes | Content | Hash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4_LR | `4lr_vs1` |  | SNOMED | 16 | Interpreter needed, Interpreter present, Presence of interpreter +13 more | d9a780b0 |

## Caveats

- Some code lists exclude specific codes. See `exceptions.csv` in the extraction for the excluded codes and whether each was applied.
- This guide is generated from the EMIS XML export. Validate it against the source search in EMIS before implementing.
