## What this search does

Start with the patients found by "GROUP1- HRC" (see below). This report has no filtering rules of its own — it reports on its starting population.

## Who we start with

1. **LTC LCS Base*** — Start with currently registered patients. Include patients who match Patients included in search LTC LCS: AF Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: CKD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: CHD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Diabetes Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Hypertension Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: NAFLD Register v2* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Asthma Adult Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Asthma CYP Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: COPD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: HF Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: PAD Register* OR patients included in search LTC LCS: Stroke/TIA Register*.
2. **LTC LCS MOC Base excluding CYP only, LR HTN only, LR Adult Asthma only** — Start with the patients found by "LTC LCS Base*". Finally include patients who do not match Patients included in search LTC LCS: Asthma CYP Register ONLY OR patients included in search On Asthma Adult Register ONLY- LTC LCS Priority Group 4 (LR Asthma Adult only) OR patients included in search On Hypertension Register ONLY- LTC LCS Priority Group 4 (LR HTN only).
3. **GROUP1- HRC** — Start with the patients found by "LTC LCS MOC Base excluding CYP only, LR HTN only, LR Adult Asthma only". Include patients who match any of: Clinical Codes with Refset: 999003371000230102 OR Refset: 999004691000230108 OR Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Type I diabetes mellitus with ulcer, Type 1 diabetes mellitus with ulcer +79 more then Latest 1; OR Patients included in search On CKD Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1(HRC) OR patients included in search On CHD Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC) OR patients included in search on Diabetes Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC) OR patients included in search On Hypertension Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC) v3 OR patients included in search On Asthma(Adult) Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC)* OR patients included in search On COPD Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC) OR patients included in search On PAD Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC) OR patients included in search On Stroke/TIA Register- LTC LCS Priority Group 1 (HRC)*.
4. **This search** then applies the rules below to that population.

## Inclusion logic, step by step

No rules — all patients from the starting population are included.

## Report output

These define what the report shows for each patient, not who is included.

### Patient Details

### Record of Interpreter Information
- **Clinical Codes** (clinical events)
  - Code in: `1hrandcomplex_vs1` (16 codes)

## Code lists used

Names below match `valueset_friendly_name` in the extraction CSVs. The hash identifies the exact code list content, so a changed hash means the codes changed.

| Search | Code list | Cluster | System | Codes | Content | Hash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GROUP1- HRC | `high_risk_complexity_vs1` | DMRES_COD | SNOMED | 1 | Refset: 999003371000230102 | ce2851bb |
| GROUP1- HRC | `high_risk_complexity_vs2` | DM_COD | SNOMED | 1 | Refset: 999004691000230108 | 2b147092 |
| GROUP1- HRC | `high_risk_complexity_vs3` |  | SNOMED | 105 | Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Type I diabetes mellitus with ulcer, Type 1 diabete... | 10923643 |
| 1_HRandCOMPLEX | `1hrandcomplex_vs1` |  | SNOMED | 16 | Interpreter needed, Interpreter present, Presence of interpreter +13 more | d9a780b0 |

## Caveats

- Some code lists exclude specific codes. See `exceptions.csv` in the extraction for the excluded codes and whether each was applied.
- This guide is generated from the EMIS XML export. Validate it against the source search in EMIS before implementing.
