5. **This search** — applies the rules below.

## Rule flow

| Rule | If patient matches | If patient does not match | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Included** | Excluded | Final — include if matched |

## Rule details

### Rule 1 of 1 — Final — include if matched

Final rule: patients who match are **included**; everyone else is excluded.

A patient matches this rule when:

- **Criterion A — Patient Details**
  - Where date of birth matches the runtime parameter `MONTH_OF_BIRTH` (prompted when the search runs)

## Code lists used

Names below match `valueset_friendly_name` in the extraction CSVs. The hash identifies the exact code list content, so a changed hash means the codes changed.

| Search | Code list | Cluster | Used in rules | System | Codes | Content | Hash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GROUP1- HRC | `high_risk_complexity_vs1` | DMRES_COD |  | SNOMED | 1 | Refset: 999003371000230102 | ce2851bb |
| GROUP1- HRC | `high_risk_complexity_vs2` | DM_COD |  | SNOMED | 1 | Refset: 999004691000230108 | 2b147092 |

## Caveats

- This search prompts for the runtime parameter `MONTH_OF_BIRTH` when run — results depend on the value entered.
- This guide is generated from the EMIS XML export. Validate it against the source search in EMIS before implementing.
