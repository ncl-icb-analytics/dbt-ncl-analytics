## What this search does

Start with currently registered patients. A patient is included when they match Rule 1.

## Who we start with

Currently registered patients.

## Inclusion logic, step by step

### Rule 1 of 1

Final rule: patients who match are **included**; everyone else is excluded.

A patient matches this rule when:
- They match the EMIS library item **HF Register** (see Caveats)

## Code lists used

None.

## Caveats

- This search references the EMIS library item `79888a16-aa09-4ef4-ba5e-a3be8e1daf23`, whose logic is not included in this XML export. It is likely **HF Register** (inferred from wrapper report "LTC LCS: HF Register*"), but this is not certain. Verify it in EMIS before implementing.
- This guide is generated from the EMIS XML export. Validate it against the source search in EMIS before implementing.
