## What this search does

Start with currently registered patients. A patient is included when they match Rule 1.

## Who we start with

Currently registered patients.

## Inclusion logic, step by step

### Rule 1 of 1

Final rule: patients who match are **included**; everyone else is excluded.

A patient matches this rule when:
- They match the EMIS library item **CHD Register** (see Caveats)

## Code lists used

None.

## Caveats

- This search references the EMIS library item `d730ee6f-1b38-4553-8f8e-7dc8b3042f4c`, whose logic is not included in this XML export. It is likely **CHD Register** (inferred from wrapper report "LTC LCS: CHD Register*"), but this is not certain. Verify it in EMIS before implementing.
