## What this search does

Start with the patients found by "LTC LCS: Diabetes Register*" (see below). A patient is included when they match Rule 1.

## Start population

1. Currently registered patients
2. **LTC LCS: Diabetes Register*** — Require Patient Details where Age at least 17 years old. Include patients who match Clinical Codes with Refset: 999004691000230108 then Latest 1.
3. **This search** — applies the rules below.

## Rule flow

| Rule | If patient matches | If patient does not match | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Included** | Excluded | Final — include if matched |

## Rule details

### Rule 1 of 1 — Final — include if matched

Final rule: patients who match are **included**; everyone else is excluded.

A patient matches this rule when:

- **Criterion A — Clinical Codes** (clinical events)
  *"Diabetes Register"*
  - Code in: `type_1_dm_vs1` (1 code — cluster DMRES_COD), or `type_1_dm_vs2` (1 code — cluster DM_COD), or `type_1_dm_vs3` (105 codes)
  - Keep only the latest matching record

## Code lists used

Names below match `valueset_friendly_name` in the extraction CSVs. The hash identifies the exact code list content, so a changed hash means the codes changed.
