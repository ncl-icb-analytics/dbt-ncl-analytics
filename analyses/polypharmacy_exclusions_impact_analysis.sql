/*
Polypharmacy Exclusions Impact Analysis
Compares OLD (MODELLING/REPORTING) vs NEW (DEV__MODELLING/DEV__REPORTING) polypharmacy counts

Purpose: Show impact of granular BNF chapter exclusions (GitHub issue #158)

OLD state: Simple chapter inclusion (chapters 1-4, 6-10)
NEW state: Granular exclusion-based approach (excludes vitamins, contraceptives, etc.)

Run this BEFORE merging to production to share impact with colleagues.
