/*
Flu Campaign Configuration - Single Source of Truth

This macro provides all campaign-specific dates and parameters in one place.
Instead of scattered hardcoded dates, everything is defined here clearly.

MULTI-CAMPAIGN SUPPORT:
All flu models work with any campaign year by changing the flu_current_campaign variable.

Available campaigns:
- 'Flu 2023-24' - 2023-24 Flu Vaccination Campaign
- 'Flu 2024-25' - 2024-25 Flu Vaccination Campaign (default)
- 'Flu 2025-26' - 2025-26 Flu Vaccination Campaign

Usage Examples:
- Default campaign: {{ flu_campaign_config() }}
- Specific campaign: {{ flu_campaign_config('Flu 2023-24') }}
- Via dbt_project.yml: Set flu_current_campaign variable, then run normally

Configuration in dbt_project.yml:
vars:
  flu_current_campaign: "Flu 2024-25"     # Change this to switch campaigns
  flu_previous_campaign: "Flu 2023-24"    # For comparison queries

CHILD AGE GROUPS:
- Preschool: Typically ages 2-3, but birth date ranges vary by campaign
- School Age: Typically ages 4-16, but birth date ranges vary by campaign
- Age-agnostic model names allow for consistent year-to-year comparisons
