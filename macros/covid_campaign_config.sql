/*
COVID Campaign Configuration - Single Source of Truth

This macro provides all campaign-specific dates and parameters in one place.
Instead of scattered hardcoded dates, everything is defined here clearly.

MULTI-CAMPAIGN SUPPORT:
All COVID models work with any campaign by changing the covid_current_campaign variable.

Available campaigns:
- 'COVID Autumn 2024' - Autumn 2024 COVID Vaccination Campaign
- 'COVID Spring 2025' - Spring 2025 COVID Vaccination Campaign  
- 'COVID Autumn 2025' - Autumn 2025 COVID Vaccination Campaign

Usage Examples:
- Default campaign: {{ covid_campaign_config() }}
- Specific campaign: {{ covid_campaign_config('COVID Autumn 2024') }}
- Via dbt_project.yml: Set covid_current_campaign variable, then run normally

Configuration in dbt_project.yml:
vars:
  covid_current_campaign: "COVID Autumn 2025"     # Change this to switch campaigns
  covid_previous_campaign: "COVID Autumn 2024"    # For comparison queries

CAMPAIGN ELIGIBILITY DIFFERENCES:
- 2024/25: Broader eligibility (age 65+ autumn, clinical risk groups)
- 2025/26: Restricted eligibility (age 75+, immunosuppressed, care home 65+ only)

COMPLEX ASTHMA STEROID WINDOWS:
Three overlapping 2-year windows to capture repeated steroid use across campaign periods.
