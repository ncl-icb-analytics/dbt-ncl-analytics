{% macro calculate_ckd_register(reference_date_expr='CURRENT_DATE()') %}
    {#
    Calculates CKD register status at a given reference date.

    Business Logic (QOF v50):
    - Age ≥18 at reference date
    - Has CKD Stage 3-5 diagnosis (CKD_COD)
    - NOT downstaged: no CKD Stage 1-2 code (CKD1AND2_COD) after latest Stage 3-5
    - NOT resolved: no resolved code (CKDRES_COD) after latest Stage 3-5

    Parameters:
        reference_date_expr: SQL expression for reference date (default: CURRENT_DATE())

    Returns: CTE with person_id, register_name, is_on_register
