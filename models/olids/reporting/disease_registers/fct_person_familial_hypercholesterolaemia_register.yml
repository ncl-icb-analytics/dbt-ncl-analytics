            Familial hypercholesterolaemia register for persons with genetic lipid disorder 
            diagnosis. Includes active patients with FH diagnosis code (FHYP_COD) and age 
            at first diagnosis â‰¥20 years. No resolution codes as FH is a genetic condition. 
            Used for cascade family screening programmes, high-intensity statin therapy 
            monitoring, and genetic cardiovascular risk management. Critical for identifying 
            families requiring lipid screening and specialist cardiovascular care.
