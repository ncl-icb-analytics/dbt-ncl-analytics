      Valproate safety monitoring clinical decision logic implementing MHRA guidelines for teratogen risk management.
      
      **CLINICAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:**
      
      This model categorises patients based on safety documentation completeness and vulnerability factors:
      
      - **Safety Documentation Requirements:**
        - PPP (Pregnancy Prevention Programme): Must be enrolled or explicitly declined/discontinued  
        - ARAF (Annual Risk Acknowledgement Form): Must be current within lookback period
      
      - **Vulnerability Factors:**
        - Pregnancy status (highest risk)
        - Learning disability (requires additional support)
        - Age-based reproductive risk: 0-6 (low), 7-12 (medium), 13-60 (high)
        - Permanent absence of pregnancy risk (lowest risk)
      
      **ACTION CATEGORIES:**
      
      1. **"Review or refer"** - Missing safety documentation or high-risk situations requiring immediate clinical review
      2. **"Keep under review"** - PPP declined/discontinued but documented; routine monitoring sufficient  
      3. **"Consider expiry of ARAF"** - All safety measures present; check if ARAF needs renewal
      4. **"No action required"** - Low risk patients requiring minimal intervention
      
      **PRIORITY ORDER (1 = Most Urgent, 9 = Least Urgent):**
      
      1. **PREGNANCY** - Immediate teratogenic risk, urgent review required
      2. **MISSING DOCS + LEARNING DISABILITY** - Vulnerable population without safety measures
      3. **MISSING DOCS + HIGH RISK AGE (13-60)** - Prime reproductive age without safety measures
      4. **MISSING DOCS + MEDIUM RISK AGE (7-12)** - Approaching reproductive age without safety measures  
      5. **PPP DECLINED** - Documented decision to decline PPP, routine monitoring
      6. **COMPLETE DOCS + LEARNING DISABILITY** - Monitor ARAF expiry in vulnerable population
      7. **COMPLETE DOCS + MEDIUM RISK AGE (7-12)** - Monitor ARAF expiry
      8. **COMPLETE DOCS + HIGH RISK AGE (13-60)** - Monitor ARAF expiry  
      9. **LOW RISK** - Age 0-6 or permanent absence of pregnancy risk, minimal monitoring
      
      One row per person in valproate cohort (non-males aged 0-55 with recent valproate orders).
