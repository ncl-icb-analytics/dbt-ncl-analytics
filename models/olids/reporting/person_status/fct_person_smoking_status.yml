            Smoking status classification based on most recent clinical observations using 
            QOF-defined cluster codes (LSMOK_COD, EXSMOK_COD, NSMOK_COD). Categories include 
            Never Smoked, Ex-Smoker, and Current Smoker. Differs from QOF smoking register which 
            focuses on current smokers and recent ex-smokers needing clinical intervention - this 
            model provides population smoking classification for population health analysis 
            and smoking cessation programme planning.
