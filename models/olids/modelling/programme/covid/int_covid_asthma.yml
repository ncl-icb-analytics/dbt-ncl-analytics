            COVID vaccination eligibility for people with active asthma using complex UKHSA business logic.
            Requires either recent asthma hospital admission (ASTADM_COD within 2 years) or combination
            of asthma diagnosis (AST_COD), recent inhaled medication (ASTRXM1_COD within 12 months),
            and oral steroid qualification (ASTRXM2_COD - 2+ prescriptions within any 2-year window
            from 3 overlapping periods). Minimum age requirement of 5 years for COVID vaccination.
