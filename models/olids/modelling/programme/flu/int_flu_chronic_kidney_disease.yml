    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with chronic kidney disease using complex staging logic.

      Key Features:

      • CKD pathways: general CKD diagnosis or stage 3-5 codes

      • Stage comparison logic: CKD35_DAT >= CKD15_DAT when both present

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • Uses CKD_COD, CKD15_COD (all stages), and CKD35_COD (stages 3-5) clusters

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns automatically

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to chronic kidney disease with staging criteria.'

            Flu vaccination eligibility for people with chronic kidney disease using QOF-aligned
            staging logic. Includes general CKD diagnosis (CKD_COD) or stage codes where
            latest stage 3-5 code (CKD35_COD) is more recent than general stage code (CKD15_COD).
            Minimum age requirement of 6 months. Eligibility logic ensures
            staging classification following clinical guidelines.
