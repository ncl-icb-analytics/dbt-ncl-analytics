/*
All epilepsy diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF epilepsy cluster IDs:
- EPIL_COD: Epilepsy diagnoses
- EPILDRUG_COD: Epilepsy drug codes

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF epilepsy register data collection
- Epilepsy care pathway monitoring
- Seizure management tracking
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
Epilepsy register includes persons with epilepsy diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per epilepsy observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_epilepsy_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
