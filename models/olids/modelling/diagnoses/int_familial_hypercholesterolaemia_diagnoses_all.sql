/*
All familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF familial hypercholesterolaemia cluster ID:
- FHYP_COD: Familial hypercholesterolaemia diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF FH register data collection
- Familial hypercholesterolaemia monitoring
- Genetic cardiovascular risk assessment
- Family screening pathway identification

Key QOF Requirements:
- Register inclusion: FH diagnosis (FHYP_COD)
- No resolution codes - FH is a genetic condition
- Age restrictions apply (usually age â‰¥20 years for QOF)
- Important for statin therapy and family screening

Note: FH does not have resolved codes as it is a genetic cardiovascular condition.
The register tracks diagnosis for family screening and intensive cholesterol management.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per FH observation.
