/*
Organisation Borough Mapping
Maps practices and PCNs to North Central London boroughs using current organisational hierarchy.
Uses Dictionary.dbo.OrganisationDescendent for GP Practice -> PCN -> CCG -> ICB hierarchy.

Special handling:
- Medicus Select Care (Y03103) manually assigned to Enfield borough regardless of CCG history,
  as they provide cross-borough services but parent organisation is Enfield-based.
- Filters to London practices only (maintains existing behaviour)
