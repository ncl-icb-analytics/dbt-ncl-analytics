    description: 'Lookup table mapping clinical codes to concepts and source code identifiers.

      Creates relationships between raw clinical codes and standardised terminology concepts, enabling efficient early filtering by source_code_id. Combines reference codesets with OLIDS terminology mappings to provide a unified lookup structure.

      Key Features:

      • Maps source codes to concept identifiers

      • Includes cluster information for grouped codes

      • Provides standardised concept display names

      • Optimised for early filtering operations

      Purpose: Support efficient clinical code lookups and concept mapping across the OLIDS system.'
