/*
All DXA scan observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF DXA cluster IDs:
- DXA_COD: DXA scan procedures
- DXA2_COD: DXA T-score measurements (with numeric results)

Clinical Purpose:
- Osteoporosis diagnostic confirmation
- Bone density monitoring
- T-score assessment for fracture risk
- Support for osteoporosis register eligibility

Key Clinical Information:
- DXA scan procedures (DXA_COD)
- T-score measurements (DXA2_COD) with numeric validation
- T-score â‰¤ -2.5 indicates osteoporosis
- Used in combination with clinical diagnosis for register inclusion

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
Use this model as input for osteoporosis register and bone health analytics.
