/*
Intermediate: CKD Lab Classification
This table classifies each personâ€™s most recent eGFR and ACR lab results according to CKD thresholds and staging criteria. It supports case finding and audit by identifying people whose labs are consistent with CKD, regardless of clinical diagnosis.
- Uses int_egfr_all, int_egfr_latest, and (if present) int_acr_all/int_acr_latest as sources.
- Applies CKD clinical rules: G-stage (G1-G5), A-stage (A1-A3), persistent abnormal results (>90 days apart), and combined inferred stage.
- Mirrors and improves on the legacy INTERMEDIATE_CKD_LAB_INFERENCE logic.
