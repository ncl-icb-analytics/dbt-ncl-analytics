          description_long: >
            Latest valid total cholesterol measurement per person supporting cardiovascular risk assessment
            and statin therapy decision-making. Provides current lipid profile status with clinical
            categorisation for cardiovascular risk stratification (<5 mmol/L desirable, <4 mmol/L secondary
            prevention target, â‰¥6.2 mmol/L high requiring intervention). Key biomarker for primary and
            secondary cardiovascular prevention programmes, diabetes care pathways, and lipid management
            protocols. Supports QOF reporting and clinical guideline compliance monitoring.
