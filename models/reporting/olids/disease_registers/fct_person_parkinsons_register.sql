/*
**Parkinson's Disease Register - Clinical Quality Measures**

Simple Register

Business Logic:
- Presence of Parkinson's disease diagnosis (PD_COD) = on register
- No resolution codes (progressive condition)

Note:
- There are no resolved codes for Parkinson's (progressive neurological condition)
- No specific age restrictions, though more common in older adults
- Latest diagnosis date used for care planning

Clinical Context:
Used for Parkinson's disease quality measures including:
- Neurological care pathway monitoring
- Medication management (levodopa, dopamine agonists, etc.)
- Multidisciplinary team coordination
- Symptom management and monitoring
- Care planning and support services
