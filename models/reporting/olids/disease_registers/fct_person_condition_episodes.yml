    description: 'Clinical condition episodes fact table tracking historical condition
      episodes without QOF restrictions.

      Captures multiple on/off cycles per person per condition for comprehensive clinical
      tracking.

      Key Features:

      • Episode-level granularity with start/end dates

      • Historical tracking of condition cycles (onset/resolved)

      • No age, date, or medication restrictions (unlike QOF registers)

      • Unified schema across all diagnosis-based conditions

      Purpose: Enables analysis of condition patterns, episode durations, and patient
      journeys across the complete clinical history.'
