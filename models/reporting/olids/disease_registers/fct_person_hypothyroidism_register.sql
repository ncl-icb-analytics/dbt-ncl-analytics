/*
**Hypothyroidism Register - Clinical Quality Measures**

Simple Register

Business Logic:
- Presence of hypothyroidism diagnosis (THY_COD) = on register
- No resolution codes (chronic condition)

Note:
- There are no resolved codes for hypothyroidism (chronic endocrine condition)
- No specific age restrictions, though more common in older adults, particularly women
- Latest diagnosis date used for care planning

Clinical Context:
Used for hypothyroidism quality measures including:
- Endocrine care pathway monitoring
- Medication management (levothyroxine monitoring)
- Thyroid function test monitoring
- Care planning and support services
