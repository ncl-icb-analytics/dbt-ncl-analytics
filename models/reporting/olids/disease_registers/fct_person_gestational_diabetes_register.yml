            Gestational diabetes mellitus register for persons with history of pregnancy-related 
            diabetes diagnosis. Includes active patients with gestational diabetes diagnosis code 
            (GESTDIAB_COD) with no age restrictions as pregnancy-related. No resolution codes as 
            gestational diabetes history is permanent record for future risk assessment. Used for 
            postpartum diabetes screening, future type 2 diabetes prevention planning, and ongoing 
            diabetes risk monitoring. Critical for identifying women at increased risk of developing 
            type 2 diabetes later in life.
