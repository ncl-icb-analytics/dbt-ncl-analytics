/*
**Frailty Register - Clinical Quality Measures**

Simple Register

Business Logic:
- Presence of frailty diagnosis (FRAILTY_DX) = on register
- Tracks latest frailty severity (mild, moderate, severe)

Note:
- There are no resolved codes for frailty (condition can fluctuate but doesn't "resolve")
- No specific age restrictions, though frailty is more common in elderly populations
- Latest severity assessment takes precedence for stratification

Clinical Context:
Used for frailty quality measures including:
- Comprehensive geriatric assessment planning
- Falls prevention and management
- Medication review and deprescribing
- Care coordination and support services
- Risk stratification for healthcare interventions
