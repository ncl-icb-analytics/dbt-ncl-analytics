            Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease register for persons with NAFLD diagnosis. 
            Includes active patients with NAFLD diagnosis using hardcoded SNOMED concept 
            codes (awaiting formal NAFLD_COD cluster implementation). No age restrictions 
            or resolution codes applied. Used for liver health assessment, cardiovascular 
            risk stratification, and potential metabolic syndrome monitoring. Critical for 
            identifying patients requiring hepatic monitoring and lifestyle interventions 
            for liver health. Currently uses hardcoded NAFLD concepts pending cluster 
            development.
