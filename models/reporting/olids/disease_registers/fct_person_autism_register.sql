/*
**Autism Spectrum Disorder Register - Clinical Quality Measures**

Simple Register

Business Logic:
- Presence of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (AUTISM_COD) = on register
- No resolution codes (lifelong condition)

Note:
- There are no resolved codes for autism (lifelong neurodevelopmental condition)
- No specific age restrictions, though typically diagnosed in childhood
- Latest diagnosis date used for care planning

Clinical Context:
Used for autism quality measures including:
- Neurodevelopmental care pathway monitoring
- Complex needs identification
- Care coordination and support services
- Mental health co-morbidity monitoring
- Healthcare access support
