Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Register - QOF v50

Business Logic:
- Age ≥18 years
- Has CKD Stage 3-5 diagnosis (CKD_COD)
- NOT downstaged: no CKD Stage 1-2 code (CKD1AND2_COD) after latest Stage 3-5
- NOT resolved: no resolved code (CKDRES_COD) after latest Stage 3-5

Lab data available separately in intermediate tables for clinical monitoring.
