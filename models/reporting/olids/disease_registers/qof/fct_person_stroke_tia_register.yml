            Stroke and transient ischaemic attack diagnosed using QOF criteria: Active
            stroke  or TIA diagnosis where latest stroke/TIA code is more recent than
            any resolution  code. Considered a lifelong condition for secondary prevention
            monitoring. Used  for cardiovascular risk management and secondary prevention
            medication monitoring.  Maps to QOF indicator STIA001 (Stroke/TIA Register).
            Uses STIA_COD for diagnosis  codes and STIARES_COD for resolution codes.
