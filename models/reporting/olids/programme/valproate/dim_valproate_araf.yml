      Annual Risk Acknowledgement Form (ARAF) events aggregation for valproate safety monitoring.
      
      **PURPOSE:**
      Tracks ARAF completion status for patients on valproate, supporting MHRA teratogen risk management requirements.
      
      **KEY FEATURES:**
      
      - **ARAF Form Types Supported:**
        - Old ARAF (SNOMED: 1366401000000107) - Legacy annual risk acknowledgement form
        - New ARAF (SNOMED: 2078951000000106) - Current annual risk acknowledgement form
      
      - **Date Tracking:**
        - Separate tracking of old vs new ARAF form dates
        - Overall latest ARAF date calculation (prioritises most recent between form types)
        - Lookback period compliance based on valproate programme codes
      
      - **Form Status Information:**
        - Boolean flags for each ARAF form type presence
        - Formatted info strings showing actual completion dates for each form type
        - Compliance status based on lookback requirements
      
      **BUSINESS RULES:**
      
      - Only includes persons with at least one ARAF event meeting lookback criteria
      - `latest_araf_overall_date` uses legacy logic: picks most recent between old/new forms
      - Info strings show "Yes (DD/MM/YYYY)" for completed forms, "No" for missing forms
      - All observation IDs, concept codes, and displays preserved for audit trail
      
      One row per person with any ARAF events meeting programme criteria.
