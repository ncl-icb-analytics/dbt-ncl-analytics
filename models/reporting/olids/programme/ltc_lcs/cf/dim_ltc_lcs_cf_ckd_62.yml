    description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CKD_62 - Identifies patients with two
      consecutive high UACR readings suggesting kidney damage and undiagnosed CKD.


      Population Scope:

      • Patients aged 17+ from LTC case finding base population

      • Two consecutive UACR readings above 4

      • Excludes patients already on CKD or diabetes registers


      Key Features:

      • Maximum daily UACR values with adjacent day duplicate filtering

      • Complete UACR testing history with latest and previous readings

      • Evidence-based case finding criteria for early kidney damage detection'
