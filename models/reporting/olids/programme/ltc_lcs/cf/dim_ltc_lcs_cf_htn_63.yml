    description: 'Case finding for hypertension in Black and South Asian patients
      with cardiovascular risk factors.


      Business Logic:

      • Targets Black and South Asian patients with elevated blood pressure and cardiovascular
      risk factors

      • Uses ethnicity-specific risk thresholds recognising higher cardiovascular
      risk in these populations

      • Identifies patients requiring culturally appropriate hypertension intervention

      • One row per eligible person with ethnicity, BP readings, and risk factor assessment'
