/*
All bowel screening programme observations from clinical records.
Uses PCD REFSET breast screening cluster IDs:
- COLCANSCREV_COD, COLCANSCR_COD: Bowel screening completed codes
- COLCANSCRDEC_COD: Bowel screening declined codes

Clinical Purpose:
- Bowel screening programme data collection
- Observation-level screening events tracking
- Foundation data for programme analysis

Key Business Rules:
- People aged 50 to 74 : invited every 2 years (amend to 2.5 years from june 2025)
- Declined/non-response status: valid for 12 months only - NON RESPONSE NOT AVAIALBLE IN PCD REFSETS
- Unsuitable status: permanent unless superseded by completed screening - NOT AVAIALBLE IN PCD REFSETS

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per breast screening observation.
