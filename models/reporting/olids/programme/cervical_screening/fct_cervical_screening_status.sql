/*
Cervical Screening Programme Status - Person-Level Analytics
Simplified tracking focused on core programme monitoring requirements.

Key Business Rules:
1. Screening Intervals:
   - Women aged 25-49: invited every 3 years
   - Women aged 50-64: invited every 5 years
   - Women outside 25-64 age range: not eligible for routine screening

2. Programme Status:
   - Up to date: Completed screening within age-appropriate interval
   - Overdue: Last screening outside age-appropriate interval
   - Never screened: No completed screening history
   - Not eligible: Outside age range or not female

Clinical Purpose:
- Programme compliance monitoring
- Screening interval tracking and invitation planning
- Population coverage reporting
