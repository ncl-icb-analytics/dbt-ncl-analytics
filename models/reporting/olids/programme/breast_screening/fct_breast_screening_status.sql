/*
All breast screening programme observations from clinical records.
Uses PCD REFSET breast screening cluster IDs:
- BRCANSCR_COD: Breast screening completed codes
- BRCANSCRDEC_COD: Breast screening declined codes

Clinical Purpose:
- Breast screening programme data collection
- Observation-level screening events tracking
- Foundation data for programme analysis

Key Business Rules:
- Females aged 50 to 71 : invited every 3 years
- Declined/non-response status: valid for 12 months only - NON RESPONSE NOT AVAIALBLE IN PCD REFSETS
- Unsuitable status: permanent unless superseded by completed screening - NOT AVAIALBLE IN PCD REFSETS

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per breast screening observation.
