/*
COVID Vaccination Uptake Fact Table (Row-Level)

This model combines eligibility and vaccination status at the person level
to provide core uptake analysis capabilities.

Key features:
- Combines eligibility information with vaccination status
- Focused on uptake business process without demographics
- Supports analysis of coverage gaps and vaccination patterns
- Works automatically with multiple COVID campaigns

Multi-Campaign Support:
- covid_2024_autumn: September 2024 - March 2025 (broader eligibility)
- covid_2025_spring: April 2025 - June 2025 (broader eligibility)  
- covid_2025_autumn: September 2025 - March 2026 (restricted eligibility)

Usage:
- Filter by campaign_id to analyze specific campaigns
- Use vaccination_status to segment by outcome (administered, declined, no record)
- Join with dim_person_demographics for demographic analysis
