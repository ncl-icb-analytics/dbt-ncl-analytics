    description: 'Analysis foundation table providing person-months with demographics and condition flags for population health analytics.

      Grain: One row per person per month (active registrations only, last 60 months)

      Key Features:

      • Person-month grain for time-series analysis

      • Demographics from dim_person_demographics_historical via temporal SCD-2 join

      • Age calculated dynamically for each analysis month using calculate_age_attributes macro

      • Condition flags for all major long-term conditions (has_* and new_* flags)

      • New episode detection for incidence analysis

      • UK financial year and quarter dimensions

      Inclusion Criteria:

      • Must have active registration during the month (from dim_person_historical_practice)

      • Must have valid birth_date_approx (inherited from dim_person_demographics_historical)

      • Must have registration history (inherited from dim_person_demographics_historical)

      • Limited to last 60 months (5-year rolling window)

      Known Limitations:

      • Address/geographic fields use current address for all historical months (address SCD dates not yet populated)

      Purpose: Supports population health reporting and clinical quality indicators. Incremental processing handles new months whilst full refresh captures late-arriving data.'
