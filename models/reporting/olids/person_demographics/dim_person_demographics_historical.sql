/*
Historical Person Demographics - SCD Type 2

Tracks changes to demographic attributes over time using SCD-2 pattern.
One row per person per change period (not per month).

Key Features:

• SCD-2 structure with effective_start_date, effective_end_date, is_current

• Tracks changes in: practice registration, ethnicity, address/geography

• No age fields (age is derived, not an attribute - calculate in consuming models)

• Change detection: new period created when practice OR ethnicity OR address changes

Data Quality:

• Only includes persons with valid birth dates

• Only includes persons with registration history

For monthly snapshots, use person_month_analysis_base.
For current state only, use dim_person_demographics.
