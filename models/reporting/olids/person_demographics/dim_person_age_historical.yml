    description: 'Historical Person Age Dimension Table (Type 2 SCD)

      Calculates age and age bands using modern Type 2 slowly changing dimensions approach.
      Only creates rows when age bands actually change.

      Key Features:

      • Type 2 SCD with effective_start_date and effective_end_date (NULL = current period)

      • 5-year rolling history window for performance optimisation

      • Modern SCD2 implementation without sentinel dates (no 9999-12-31 values)

      • Age milestones trigger new periods (every 5 years for age band changes)

      • Efficient storage - periods created only when age bands change, not monthly

      Implementation Notes:

      • Uses NULL effective_end_date for current periods (not sentinel dates)

      • Limited to last 5 years of data to balance completeness with performance

      • Change points triggered by: age milestones at 5-year intervals (0, 5, 10, 15, etc.)

      For analysis queries, join using:
      WHERE analysis_date >= effective_start_date AND (effective_end_date IS NULL OR analysis_date < effective_end_date)'
