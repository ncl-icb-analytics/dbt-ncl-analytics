            Tracks completion of 9 diabetes care processes required for QOF reporting:
            the 8 standard care processes (HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, creatinine, ACR, foot
            examination, BMI, smoking status) plus retinal screening for diabetic retinopathy. All 
            measurements and screenings must be completed within 12 months for QOF compliance.
            Supports diabetes care pathway monitoring and quality improvement.
