    description: 'Blood pressure control assessment using NICE NG136 guidelines with patient-specific targets.

      One row per person that has a blood pressure recording.

      Treatment Targets:

      • Standard (under 80): <140/90 mmHg

      • Age 80+: <150/90 mmHg

      • Type 2 Diabetes: <140/90 mmHg

      • CKD (under 80): <140/90 mmHg

      • CKD with ACR ≥70: <130/80 mmHg

      Monitoring Intervals:

      • T2DM/CKD/HTN: 12 months

      • Age ≥40 (no conditions): 60 months (5 years)

      • Age <40 (no conditions): no threshold

      Diagnostic Thresholds:

      • Stage 1 - Clinic: ≥140/90 mmHg

      • Stage 1 - ABPM/HBPM: ≥135/85 mmHg

      • Stage 2 - Clinic: ≥160/100 mmHg

      • Stage 2 - ABPM/HBPM: ≥150/95 mmHg

      • Stage 3 - Severe: ≥180/120 mmHg

      Purpose: Supports hypertension management and QOF reporting with personalised BP targets based on patient comorbidities.'

            Complete NICE NG136 hypertension guidance including treatment targets for different 
            patient populations and diagnostic thresholds for hypertension staging. Treatment 
            targets vary by age, diabetes status, and CKD severity. Diagnostic criteria use 
            different thresholds for clinic vs ABPM/HBPM measurements across 3 severity stages.
