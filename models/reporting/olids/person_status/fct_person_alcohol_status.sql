/*
Person-level alcohol status combining AUDIT scores and disorder diagnoses.
Provides comprehensive alcohol risk assessment for population health management.

Business Logic:
1. Uses most recent AUDIT/AUDIT-C score as primary indicator
2. Considers alcohol disorder diagnoses for additional context
3. Recent AUDIT scores override older disorder codes (unless disorder is more recent)
4. Applies 12-month recency window for conflicting assessments

This is PERSON-LEVEL data - one row per person with any alcohol-related data.
