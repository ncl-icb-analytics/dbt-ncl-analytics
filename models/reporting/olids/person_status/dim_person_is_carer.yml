    description: Dimension table providing the latest recorded carer status for 
      persons who have a carer status record. Only includes persons with a 
      record in ISACARER_COD, NOTACARER_COD, or UNPAIDCARER_COD clusters. This 
      table specifically tracks patients who are carers themselves, not patients
      who have carers.
