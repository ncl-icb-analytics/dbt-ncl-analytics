      BNF chapter and subchapter exclusions for polypharmacy calculation.

      Defines which BNF codes should be excluded from polypharmacy medication counts.
      Uses hierarchical approach where subchapter-level rules (4-digit) override
      chapter-level rules (2-digit).

          TRUE to exclude from polypharmacy, FALSE to explicitly include.
          FALSE values are used to override chapter-level exclusions
          (e.g., include 5.3.1 HIV even though chapter 5 is mostly excluded)

              values: [true, false]
