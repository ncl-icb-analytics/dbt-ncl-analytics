      Global OLIDS data refresh date based on practice upload consensus.

      Calculates the most recent date where at least 150 practices have uploaded observation data,
      excluding future dates. This consensus approach filters out both stale practices and those
      entering incorrect future dates, providing a reliable indicator of when most OLIDS data was
      last refreshed.

      Returns a single row with one column: global_data_refresh_date.
