-- Patient Registrations - Uses episode_of_care with registration type filtering
-- Processes episode_of_care filtered to registration episodes only (concept code 24531000000104)
-- Uses PATIENT_PERSON bridge table to get canonical person_id
-- Handles deceased patients and active registration determination
-- Aligns with PDS comparison methodology
