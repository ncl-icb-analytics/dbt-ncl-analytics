/*
All multiple sclerosis diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses multiple sclerosis cluster ID:
- MS_COD: Multiple sclerosis diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- Multiple sclerosis register data collection
- Neurological condition monitoring
- Care pathway tracking
- Disease-modifying therapy monitoring

Clinical Context:
Multiple sclerosis register includes persons with MS diagnosis codes.
MS is a chronic neurological condition with no resolution codes.
No age restrictions applied - condition typically diagnosed in young to middle-aged adults.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per MS observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_ms_register.sql which applies business rules.
