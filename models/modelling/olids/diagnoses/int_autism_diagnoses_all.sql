/*
All autism spectrum disorder diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses autism cluster ID:
- AUTISM_COD: Autism spectrum disorder diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- Autism register data collection
- Neurodevelopmental condition monitoring
- Care pathway tracking
- Complex needs identification

Clinical Context:
Autism register includes persons with autism spectrum disorder diagnosis codes.
Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition with no resolution codes.
No age restrictions applied - condition is typically diagnosed in childhood but persists throughout life.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per autism observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_autism_register.sql which applies business rules.
