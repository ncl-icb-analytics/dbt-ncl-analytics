    description: 'Parkinsons disease diagnosis observations for neurological condition register management.

      Key Features:

      • Uses PD_COD cluster for diagnosis identification

      • Supports Parkinsons disease register data collection

      • Enables neurological condition monitoring and care pathway tracking

      • No resolution codes as Parkinsons is a progressive condition

      Purpose: Provide observation-level data for Parkinsons disease tracking and care management.'
