/*
All asthma diagnoses from clinical records.
Uses QOF cluster IDs AST_COD (diagnosis) and ASTRES_COD (resolved).

Clinical Purpose:
- Asthma register inclusion for QOF respiratory disease management
- Respiratory care pathway identification and monitoring
- Childhood and adult asthma management tracking

QOF Context:
Asthma register includes persons with asthma diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions (typically 6+ years) applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
Use this model as input for asthma register and respiratory care models.
