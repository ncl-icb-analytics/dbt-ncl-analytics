/*
All learning disability diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF learning disability cluster IDs:
- LD_COD: Learning disability diagnoses
- LDREM_COD: Learning disability exclusion codes (removed from register)

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF learning disability register data collection
- Learning disability support and monitoring
- Annual health checks eligibility

QOF Context (v50):
Learning disability register includes persons with LD diagnosis who have not been
excluded (LDREM_COD after LD_COD). No age restriction in QOF spec.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per learning disability observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_learning_disability_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
