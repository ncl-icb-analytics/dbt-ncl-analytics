/*
All learning disability diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF learning disability cluster IDs:
- LD_COD: Learning disability diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF learning disability register data collection
- Learning disability support and monitoring
- Annual health checks eligibility
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
Learning disability register includes persons with learning disability diagnosis codes
who have not been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically â‰¥14 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per learning disability observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_learning_disability_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
