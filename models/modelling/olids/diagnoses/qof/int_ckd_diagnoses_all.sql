/*
All chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF CKD cluster IDs:
- CKD_COD: CKD diagnoses
- CKDRES_COD: CKD resolved/remission codes

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF CKD register data collection
- Kidney function monitoring
- CKD staging and progression tracking
- Resolution status monitoring

QOF Context:
CKD register includes persons with CKD diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically ≥18 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per CKD observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_ckd_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
