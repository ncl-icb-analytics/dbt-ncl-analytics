/*
All coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnoses from clinical records.
Uses QOF cluster ID CHD_COD for all forms of CHD diagnosis.

Clinical Purpose:
- CHD register inclusion for QOF cardiovascular disease management
- Cardiovascular risk stratification and monitoring
- Secondary prevention pathway identification

QOF Context:
CHD register follows simple diagnosis-only pattern - any CHD diagnosis code
qualifies for register inclusion. No resolution codes or complex criteria.
This is a lifelong condition register for cardiovascular secondary prevention.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per CHD observation.
Use this model as input for CHD register and cardiovascular risk models.
