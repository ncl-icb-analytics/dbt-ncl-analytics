/*
All peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnoses from clinical records.
Uses QOF cluster ID PAD_COD for all forms of PAD diagnosis.

Clinical Purpose:
- PAD register inclusion for QOF cardiovascular disease management
- Cardiovascular risk stratification and monitoring
- Secondary prevention pathway identification

QOF Context:
PAD register follows simple diagnosis-only pattern - any PAD diagnosis code
qualifies for register inclusion. No resolution codes or complex criteria.
This is a lifelong condition register for cardiovascular secondary prevention.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per PAD observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_pad_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
