/*
All cancer diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF cancer cluster IDs:
- CAN_COD: Cancer diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF cancer register data collection
- Cancer care pathway monitoring
- Oncology treatment tracking
- Resolution/remission status tracking

QOF Context:
Cancer register includes persons with cancer diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved/in remission. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
No specific age restrictions for cancer register.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per cancer observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_cancer_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
