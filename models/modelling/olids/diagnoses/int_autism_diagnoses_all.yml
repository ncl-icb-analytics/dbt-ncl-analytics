    description: 'Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis observations for neurodevelopmental condition register management.

      Key Features:

      • Uses AUTISM_COD cluster for diagnosis identification

      • Supports autism register data collection

      • Enables neurodevelopmental condition monitoring and care pathway tracking

      • No resolution codes as autism is a lifelong condition

      • Distinct from learning disability - can co-occur but tracked separately

      Purpose: Provide observation-level data for autism tracking and complex needs identification.'
