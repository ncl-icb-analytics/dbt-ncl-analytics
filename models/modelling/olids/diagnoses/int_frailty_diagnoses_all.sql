/*
All frailty diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses frailty cluster ID:
- FRAILTY_DX: Frailty diagnoses (includes mild, moderate, severe frailty states)

Clinical Purpose:
- Frailty register data collection
- Frailty assessment and stratification
- Care planning for frail elderly populations
- Risk assessment and intervention tracking

Clinical Context:
Frailty register includes persons with frailty diagnosis codes.
Frailty can range from mild to severe and may change over time.
No specific resolution codes as frailty status can fluctuate.

Frailty codes included:
- 248279007: Frailty
- 404904002: Frail elderly
- 925791000000100: Mild frailty
- 925831000000107: Moderate frailty
- 925861000000102: Severe frailty

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per frailty observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_frailty_register.sql which applies business rules.
