/*
All cerebral palsy diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses cerebral palsy cluster ID:
- CEREBRALP_COD: Cerebral palsy diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- Cerebral palsy register data collection
- Neurological condition monitoring
- Care pathway tracking
- Support services planning

Clinical Context:
Cerebral palsy register includes persons with cerebral palsy diagnosis codes.
Cerebral palsy is a lifelong neurological condition with no resolution codes.
No age restrictions applied - condition is typically diagnosed in childhood but persists throughout life.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per cerebral palsy observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_cerebral_palsy_register.sql which applies business rules.
