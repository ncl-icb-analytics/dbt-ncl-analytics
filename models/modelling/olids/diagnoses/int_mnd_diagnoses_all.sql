/*
All motor neurone disease diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses motor neurone disease cluster ID:
- MND_COD: Motor neurone disease diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- Motor neurone disease register data collection
- Neurological condition monitoring
- Care pathway tracking
- Palliative care planning support

Clinical Context:
Motor neurone disease register includes persons with MND diagnosis codes.
MND is a progressive neurological condition with no resolution codes.
No age restrictions applied - condition can occur at any age though more common in older adults.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per MND observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_mnd_register.sql which applies business rules.
