/*
All Parkinson's disease diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses Parkinson's cluster ID:
- PD_COD: Parkinson's disease diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- Parkinson's disease register data collection
- Neurological condition monitoring
- Care pathway tracking
- Medication management support

Clinical Context:
Parkinson's disease register includes persons with Parkinson's diagnosis codes.
Parkinson's is a progressive neurological condition with no resolution codes.
No age restrictions applied - condition can occur at any age though more common in older adults.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per Parkinson's observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_parkinsons_register.sql which applies business rules.
