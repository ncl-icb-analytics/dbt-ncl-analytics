/*
All anxiety diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses anxiety cluster IDs:
- ANX_COD: Anxiety diagnoses
- ANXRES_COD: Anxiety resolved/remission codes

Clinical Purpose:
- Anxiety register data collection
- Mental health care pathway monitoring
- Anxiety severity tracking
- Resolution status tracking

Clinical Context:
Anxiety register includes persons with anxiety diagnosis codes who may or may not
have been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
No age restrictions applied - condition can occur at any age.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per anxiety observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_anxiety_register.sql which applies business rules.
