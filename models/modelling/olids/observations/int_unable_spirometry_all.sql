/*
All unable-to-have-spirometry observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF cluster ID SPIRPU_COD for patients where spirometry is unsuitable.

Clinical Purpose:
- COPD register spirometry confirmation requirements (post-April 2023)
- Alternative pathway for COPD register inclusion when spirometry cannot be performed
- Documentation of contraindications or patient inability

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
One row per unable spirometry observation.
Use this model as input for COPD register spirometry validation.
