    description: 'Intermediate: Latest HbA1c Observations - Most recent valid HbA1c measurement per person.

      Clinical Logic:

      • Provides current glycaemic control status for diabetes management

      • Supports diabetes care decision-making and QOF reporting

      • Enables current diabetes control assessment and treatment planning


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per person with their most recent valid HbA1c

      • Includes only patients with valid HbA1c measurements

      • Supports both IFCC and DCCT measurement formats


      Key Features:

      • Latest valid HbA1c identification with measurement type preservation

      • Clinical diabetes control categorisation for care pathway management

      • QOF target achievement flags for quality indicator reporting

      • Diabetes diagnostic indicators for clinical decision support'

            Latest valid HbA1c measurement per person supporting diabetes management and care pathway
            decisions. Provides current glycaemic control status with both IFCC and DCCT measurement
            format support. Includes clinical categorisation for diabetes control assessment (≤48 mmol/mol
            excellent, ≤58 mmol/mol adequate, >75 mmol/mol poor), QOF target achievement flags (≤58 mmol/mol),
            and diagnostic indicators (≥48 mmol/mol diabetes, ≥42 mmol/mol prediabetes). Key biomarker
            for diabetes care quality monitoring and treatment optimisation.
