/*
All BMI measurements for adults aged 18+ including both recorded BMI values and calculated BMI from HEIGHT/WEIGHT.
Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) aged 18+ with basic validation (10-150 range).
Uses ethnicity-adjusted BMI categories per NICE NG246 for cardiometabolic risk populations.
Avoids calculating BMI on dates where recorded BMI already exists for the same person.
Age restriction: Adult BMI categories are only clinically appropriate for ages 18+.
