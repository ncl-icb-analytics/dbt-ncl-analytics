          description_long: >
            Latest valid serum creatinine measurement per person supporting kidney function assessment
            and chronic kidney disease monitoring. Provides current renal function status with clinical
            categorisation (normal ≤125 μmol/L males/≤110 μmol/L females, elevated >150 μmol/L suggesting
            CKD Stage 3+, significantly elevated >200 μmol/L requiring investigation). Key biomarker for 
            CKD pathway management, medication dosing adjustments, and cardiovascular risk assessment.
            Supports QOF diabetes care processes and nephrology referral pathways.
