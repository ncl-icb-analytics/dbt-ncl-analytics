/*
Blood Pressure Events - Event-based consolidation (one row per person per date)
===============================================================================
Aggregates from int_blood_pressure_observations_base.

Pairing (within-reading, not by date):
- Systolic and diastolic are separate observation rows. They are paired within
  a single reading via PARENT_OBSERVATION_ID (one parent holds both children in
  ~99.7% of cases), NOT by taking the max systolic and max diastolic of the
  date. The old date-level MAX/MAX approach fabricated a (max systolic, max
  diastolic) pair from two different readings on multi-reading days (~13% of
  person-dates), which pessimistically overstated uncontrolled BP downstream.
- Rows without a parent_observation_id (~7%) fall back to a single date-level
  pseudo-reading (max systolic / max diastolic for that date).

Representative reading per date (lowest-of-day):
- clinical_effective_date carries no usable time-of-day (all OLIDS observations
  are stored at midnight/01:00), so "latest reading of the day" is impossible.
- One reading per person per date is selected by the lowest-systolic rule
  (lowest systolic, then lowest diastolic) - the conventional choice for BP
  control, discounting initial/white-coat elevated readings that are re-checked.
  systolic_value and diastolic_value are therefore a real, paired reading.

Flags:
- is_hypertensive_range is a date-level OR across ALL readings (any reading in
  hypertensive range on its own clinic/home threshold). Semantics are unchanged
  and independent of the representative selection.
- is_home_bp_event / is_abpm_bp_event describe the REPRESENTATIVE reading, so
  the value and its measurement context are on the same scale for downstream
  threshold selection.

Clinical validation:
- Both systolic and diastolic values present
- Systolic: 40-350 mmHg, Diastolic: 20-200 mmHg
