Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. ANY of the following worker codes (latest occurrence):
   - Care home worker (CAREHOME_COD)
   - Nursing home worker (NURSEHOME_COD)  
   - Domiciliary care worker (DOMCARE_COD)
2. AND aged 16 years or older (minimum age for health/social care worker flu vaccination)

Combination rule - multiple worker categories with OR logic.
