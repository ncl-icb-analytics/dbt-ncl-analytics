      history.

      Key Features:

      • Single pathway: emergency asthma admission codes (ASTADM_COD)

      • Any historical admission qualifies (no time restrictions)

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • No diagnosis or medication requirements (admission alone sufficient)

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns automatically

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to severe asthma history
      requiring emergency care.'

            history.
            Uses ASTADM_COD cluster codes with any historical admission qualifying
            (no time
            restrictions). This pathway recognises severe asthma risk without requiring
            ongoing diagnosis or medication evidence. Minimum age requirement of 6
            months.
