    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with diabetes or Addisons
      disease with resolution logic.

      Key Features:

      • Two eligibility pathways: Addisons disease (ADDIS_COD) or active diabetes
      (DIAB_COD)

      • Exclusion logic for resolved diabetes (DMRES_COD superseding DIAB_COD)

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • Uses latest diabetes code vs latest resolved code comparison

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns

      • Deduplicates to best qualifying event per person

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to diabetes or related
      conditions.'

            Flu vaccination eligibility for people with diabetes mellitus or Addisons
            disease.
            Includes active diabetes (DIAB_COD) where latest diabetes code is more
            recent than
            any resolved code (DMRES_COD), or Addisons disease (ADDIS_COD) regardless
            of resolution.
            Minimum age requirement of 6 months. Uses latest diabetes vs resolution
            code comparison logic.
