    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with diabetes or Addisons disease with resolution logic.

      Key Features:

      • Two eligibility pathways: Addisons disease (ADDIS_COD) or active diabetes (DIAB_COD)

      • Exclusion logic for resolved diabetes (DMRES_COD superseding DIAB_COD)

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • Uses latest diabetes code vs latest resolved code comparison

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns

      • Deduplicates to best qualifying event per person

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to diabetes or related conditions.'
