/*
Flu Pregnancy Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. Scenario A: Pregnant at campaign start (9 months before) with no subsequent delivery, OR
2. Scenario B: Became pregnant between campaign start and reference date (remains eligible even if delivered)
3. AND aged 12 years or older (minimum age for pregnancy flu vaccination)

Campaign-specific logic:
- Scenario A: Pregnant 9 months before campaign start with no subsequent delivery
- Scenario B: Pregnancy code between campaign_start_date and campaign_reference_date

Simplified rule - focuses on flu season timing rather than complex pregnancy state logic.
