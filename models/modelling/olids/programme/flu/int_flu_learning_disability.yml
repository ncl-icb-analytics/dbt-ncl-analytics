    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with learning disabilities using severity classification.

      Key Features:

      • Two pathway logic: severe learning disability (SEV_LRNDIS_COD) or general learning disability (LEARNDIS_COD)

      • Earliest occurrence in medical history qualifies

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • Includes all severities of learning disability

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns automatically

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to learning disability conditions.'

            Flu vaccination eligibility for people with learning disabilities of any severity.
            Uses both severe learning disability codes (SEV_LRNDIS_COD) and general learning
            disability codes (LEARNDIS_COD) with earliest occurrence qualifying. Minimum age
            requirement of 6 months for flu vaccination. Supports vulnerable population protection.
