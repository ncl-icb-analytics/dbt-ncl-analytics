/*
Under 65 At Risk - Flu Vaccination Eligibility Parent Category

This parent category aggregates all clinical condition-based eligibility
for people under 65 years old. It provides a single view of the "under 65 at risk" 
cohort whilst preserving individual condition details.

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they are:
1. Under 65 years of age at campaign reference date, AND
2. Have ANY clinical condition that makes them eligible for flu vaccination

This complements the age-based eligibility (65+, children) by providing
a clear view of the clinical risk-based cohort under 65.
