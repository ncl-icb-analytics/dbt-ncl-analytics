/*
Simplified Chronic Heart Disease Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. A chronic heart disease diagnosis (CHD_COD) - earliest occurrence in history
2. AND aged 6 months or older (minimum age for flu vaccination)

This is a straightforward "simple" rule - single diagnosis code with age restrictions.
Much clearer than the previous macro-based approach.
