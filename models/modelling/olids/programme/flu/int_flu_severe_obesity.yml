    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with severe obesity using BMI logic and age restrictions.

      Key Features:

      • BMI threshold logic: BMI ≥40 or severe obesity codes

      • Complex BMI calculation using BMI_COD values vs BMI_STAGE_COD timing

      • Age restriction: 18+ years (adults only)

      • Uses latest BMI values and severe obesity stage codes

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns automatically

      Purpose: Identify people with severe obesity eligible for flu vaccination due to increased infection risk.'

            Flu vaccination eligibility for people with severe obesity (BMI ≥40) using
            complex BMI logic. Uses latest BMI values (BMI_COD) ≥40 or severe obesity

            Age restriction of 18+ years for adults only.
