/*
Simplified Severe Obesity (BMI) Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. ANY of the following evidence of severe obesity:
   - BMI value >= 40 (from BMI_COD observations)
   - Severe obesity diagnosis code (SEV_OBESITY_COD)
2. AND aged 18 years or older (minimum age for obesity flu vaccination)

Hierarchical rule - BMI values and diagnostic codes with threshold logic.
