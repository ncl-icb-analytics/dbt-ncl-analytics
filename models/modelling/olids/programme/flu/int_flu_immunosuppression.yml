    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with immunosuppression using
      pathway logic.

      Key Features:

      • Four eligibility pathways: diagnosis (IMMDX_COD), medication (IMMRX_COD),
      admin codes (IMMADM_COD), or chemotherapy/radiotherapy (DXT_CHEMO_COD)

      • Time-limited medication and treatment pathways (6 months lookback from campaign)

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • Complex logic combining historical diagnoses with recent treatment indicators

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns automatically

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to immunosuppression
      from causes.'

            Flu vaccination eligibility for people with immunosuppression from any
            cause including
            diagnosis codes (IMMDX_COD), recent immunosuppressant medications (IMMRX_COD
            within 6 months),
            recent admin codes indicating immunosuppression (IMMADM_COD within 6 months),
            or
            recent chemotherapy/radiotherapy (DXT_CHEMO_COD within 6 months). Uses
            6-month
            lookback period for medication/treatment pathways to capture currently
            immunosuppressed patients.
