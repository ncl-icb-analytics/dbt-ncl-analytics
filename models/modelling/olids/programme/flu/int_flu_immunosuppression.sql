/*
Simplified Immunosuppression Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. ANY of the following evidence of immunosuppression:
   - Immunosuppression diagnosis (IMMDX_COD) - latest occurrence
   - Immunosuppression medication (IMMRX_COD) since lookback date
   - Immunosuppression administration (IMMADM_COD) since lookback date  
   - Chemotherapy/radiotherapy (DXT_CHEMO_COD) since lookback date
2. AND aged 6 months or older (minimum age for flu vaccination)

Combination rule - multiple evidence sources with OR logic.
