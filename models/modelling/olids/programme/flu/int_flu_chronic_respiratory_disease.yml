    description: 'Flu vaccination eligibility for people with chronic respiratory conditions combining asthma and other lung diseases.

      Key Features:

      • Three eligibility pathways: active asthma management, asthma admission, or chronic respiratory diagnosis (RESP_COD)

      • Combines existing asthma eligibility rules with additional respiratory disease codes

      • Age restriction: minimum 6 months for flu vaccination

      • Deduplicates respiratory conditions to best qualifying event per person

      • Generates data for current and previous flu campaigns automatically

      Purpose: Identify people eligible for flu vaccination due to chronic respiratory conditions including asthma and COPD.'

            Flu vaccination eligibility for people with chronic respiratory conditions including
            asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases. Combines three pathways:
            active asthma management (AST_GROUP), asthma admission history (AST_ADM_GROUP), or
            chronic respiratory disease diagnosis (RESP_COD). Minimum age requirement of 6 months.
