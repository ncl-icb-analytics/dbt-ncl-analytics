/*
Simplified Carer Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. Latest carer code (CARER_COD) AND no more recent not-carer code (NOTCARER_COD)
   - CARER_COD > NOTCARER_COD (or no NOTCARER_COD at all)
2. AND NOT eligible via other clinical risk groups, BMI, or pregnancy
3. AND aged 5 years or older (minimum age for carer flu vaccination)

Exclusion rule - carer status with exclusion from other eligibility routes.
