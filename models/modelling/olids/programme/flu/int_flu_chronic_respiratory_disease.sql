/*
Simplified Chronic Respiratory Disease Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. ANY of the following respiratory conditions:
   - Eligible via Active Asthma Management (AST_GROUP)
   - Eligible via Asthma Admission (AST_ADM_GROUP)  
   - Chronic respiratory disease diagnosis (RESP_COD) - earliest occurrence
2. AND aged 6 months or older (minimum age for flu vaccination)

Combination rule - combines existing asthma eligibility with additional respiratory codes.
