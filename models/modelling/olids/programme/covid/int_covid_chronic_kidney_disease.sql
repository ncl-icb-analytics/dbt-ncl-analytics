/*
COVID Chronic Kidney Disease Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. Chronic kidney disease diagnosis (CKD_COV_COD) - any time, OR
2. CKD stage codes (CKD15_COD) where latest stage is 3-5 (CKD35_COD)
3. AND aged 5+ years (minimum age for COVID vaccination)
4. Only eligible in 2024/25 campaigns (broader eligibility)

Hierarchical rule - stage codes override diagnosis if present.
This condition is NOT eligible in 2025/26 restricted campaigns.
