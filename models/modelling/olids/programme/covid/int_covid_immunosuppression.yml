      Grain: One row per person per campaign who meets immunosuppression criteria

      Identifies people:
      • Diagnosed with immunosuppression (any time)
      • Recent immunosuppressant medication (6 months)
      • Recent chemotherapy/radiotherapy (6 months)
      • Age varies by campaign (any age 2024/25, 6 months-74 years 2025/26)

            COVID vaccination eligibility for people with immunosuppression from any cause including
            diagnosis codes (IMMDX_COV_COD), recent immunosuppressant medications (IMMRX_COD within 6 months),
            recent admin codes indicating immunosuppression (IMMADM_COD within 3 years), or
            recent chemotherapy/radiotherapy (DXT_CHEMO_COD within 6 months). Uses different
            lookback periods for medication/treatment pathways to capture currently immunosuppressed patients.
            Age eligibility varies by campaign type.
