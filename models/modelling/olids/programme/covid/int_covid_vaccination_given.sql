/*
COVID Vaccination Given Rule

Business Rule: Person with COVID vaccination status if they have:
1. COVID vaccination administration code (COVADM_COD) within campaign period, OR
2. COVID vaccination medication (COVRX_COD) within campaign period
3. No age restrictions (applies to all ages)

This is used for tracking/reporting vaccination uptake, not eligibility determination.
Tracks vaccinations by campaign period (autumn vs spring).
