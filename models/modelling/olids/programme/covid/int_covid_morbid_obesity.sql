/*
COVID Morbid Obesity Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. BMI ≥ 40 (latest BMI value), OR
2. Severe obesity stage code (most recent stage code)
3. AND aged 18+ years (adults only - obesity not assessed in under 18s)
4. Only eligible in 2024/25 campaigns (broader eligibility)

Hierarchical rule - stage codes override BMI values if more recent.
This condition is NOT eligible in 2025/26 restricted campaigns.
