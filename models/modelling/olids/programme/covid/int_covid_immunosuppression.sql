COVID Immunosuppression Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. ANY of the following evidence of immunosuppression:
   - Immunosuppression diagnosis (IMMDX_COV_COD) - latest occurrence
   - Immunosuppression medication (IMMRX_COD) since lookback date (6 months)
   - Immunosuppression administration (IMM_ADM_COD) since lookback date (3 years)  
   - Chemotherapy/radiotherapy (DXT_CHEMO_COD) since lookback date (6 months)
2. AND aged 6 months to 74 years (for 2025/26 campaigns) or any age (for 2024/25)

Combination rule - multiple evidence sources with OR logic.
