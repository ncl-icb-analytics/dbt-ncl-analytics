/*
COVID Long-term Residential Care Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they are:
1. Currently residing in long-term residential care (care home)
2. Latest residence code is from LONGRES_COD cluster
3. AND aged 65+ at campaign reference date (for care home specific eligibility)

Hierarchical rule - latest residence status determines eligibility.
This is a key eligibility group for COVID campaigns.
