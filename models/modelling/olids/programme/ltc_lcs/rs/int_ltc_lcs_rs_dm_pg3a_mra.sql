-- LTC LCS: Diabetes Register - Priority Group 3A (Moderate Risk A)
-- Parent population: Diabetes register, excluding PG1 (HRC) and PG2 (HR)
--
-- Logic:
-- - Rule 1: Exclude PG1 or PG2
-- - Rule 2: HbA1c 58-75 (cascade - go to next rule if passed, exclude if failed)
-- - Rule 3: MI (vs2) or cerebral thrombosis (vs3) or TIA (vs4) in last 12 months (include)
-- - Rule 4: eGFR 30-44 (vs5) (include)
-- - Rule 5: ACR > 30 (vs6) (include)
-- - Rule 6: BP ≥140 systolic OR ≥90 diastolic (include, if failed → exclude)
--
-- BP logic uses int_blood_pressure_all with 140/90 threshold for risk stratification
