-- LTC LCS: CHD Register - Priority Group 1 (High Risk & Complex)
-- Implements inclusion/exclusion rules for high-risk & complex patient identification
-- Parent population: CHD register
--
-- Inclusion rules:
-- - Rule 1a: First/new or flare-up of CHD within last month or
-- - Rule 1b: Significant CHD within last month. Rule 1b is not possible with current data.
--   'Significant' CHD within last month is a data gap. Problem significance is not in OLIDS. 
--   It is also not used consistently by all practices and not used in a consistent way.
