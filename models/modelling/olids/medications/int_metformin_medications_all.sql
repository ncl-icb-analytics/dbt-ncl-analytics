/*
All metformin medication orders using the METFORMIN_RX cluster, including fixed-dose
combinations (with a DPP-4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor or thiazolidinedione).
Metformin is a single ingredient so there is no per-drug categorisation; the value of
this model over BNF 6.1.2.2 is that it captures combination products (which BNF codes
under 6.1.2.3 and so miss).
Membership is cluster-driven and date-independent; date filtering is applied by
consumers (fct/pit models) and recency flags are provided for convenience.
Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
