/*
Latest repeat medication orders that are currently active based on duration.
Filters to repeat prescriptions using authorisation_type_concept_id = '182918009'.

Currency logic:
- Takes the most recent order for each person × medication combination
- Considers medication "current" if: order_date + duration_days >= CURRENT_DATE
- Defaults to 28 days duration if NULL (99% of records have duration populated)

Note: Uses medication_order table (not statement) as each order represents when the
GP issues the medication (sends to pharmacy or prints FP10) with accurate duration_days.

Grain: One row per person × medication (latest order only, filtered to current)
