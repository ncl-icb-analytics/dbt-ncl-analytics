/*
Historical polypharmacy medication counts as SCD Type 2 (last 5 years).

Event-based slowly changing dimension tracking polypharmacy medication burden
over time. Only creates new rows when medication count changes, providing
efficient storage and accurate historical tracking.

Example output for a patient:
- 2020-01-15 to 2021-08-10: 4 medications (not polypharmacy)
- 2021-08-11 to 2023-03-05: 5 medications (polypharmacy starts)
- 2023-03-06 to NULL: 6 medications (current)

Grain: One row per person per distinct medication count period
