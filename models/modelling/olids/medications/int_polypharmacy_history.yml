      Historical polypharmacy medication counts as SCD Type 2 (last 5 years).

      Grain: One row per person per distinct medication count period (5-year lookback)

      Inclusion criteria:
      - Repeat prescriptions only (authorisation_type = '182918009')
      - Polypharmacy-scope medications (via int_polypharmacy_medications_list)
      - Medication count periods lasting 3+ days (smoothed to filter transient fluctuations)
      - Last 5 years only

      Polypharmacy scope uses exclusion-based filtering:
      - Excludes most infections (except HIV and hepatitis antivirals)
      - Excludes vitamins, minerals, nutrition products
      - Excludes contraceptives, thyroid drugs, topicals
      - Excludes devices, dressings, appliances
      - See int_polypharmacy_medications_list for complete scope definition

      Event-based SCD tracking medication burden changes over time.
      Creates new row only when medication count changes and persists for 3+ days.

      Example periods:
      - 2020-01-15 to 2021-08-10: 4 medications (not polypharmacy)
      - 2021-08-11 to 2023-03-05: 5 medications (polypharmacy starts)
      - 2023-03-06 to 2025-10-06: 6 medications (current)

      Use for trending analysis and historical polypharmacy status.
      Not used for current state (see int_polypharmacy_current instead).
