/*
Current polypharmacy medication counts and flags.

Calculates current state directly from int_polypharmacy_medications_current
(source of truth for current medications) rather than relying on historical
SCD table which uses smoothing and may not reflect exact current state.

Polypharmacy thresholds (NHSBSA standard):
- 5+ medications: Standard polypharmacy threshold
- 10+ medications: Severe/complex polypharmacy threshold

Grain: One row per person with current polypharmacy-scope medications
