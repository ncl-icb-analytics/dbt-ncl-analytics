    description: |
      Simple count showing total registered patients and patients allowed for secondary use.
      The difference represents patients opted out (any opt-out type).

      Future-proof design: As new opt-out types are added to dim_person_secondary_use_allowed,
      the counts automatically adjust without code changes.
