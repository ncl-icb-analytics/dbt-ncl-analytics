    description: |
      Centralised metadata tracking for OLIDS data freshness and table update timestamps (secondary use).

      Provides two types of metrics:
      - **Global data refresh**: Consensus date where â‰¥150 practices have uploaded data (excludes future dates and filters out stale practices)
      - **Table refresh**: Last modified timestamps for all OLIDS tables in REPORTING and PUBLISHED_REPORTING databases

      Table timestamps are retrieved from Snowflake's INFORMATION_SCHEMA, ensuring accuracy regardless of partial dbt runs.

      See metadata_refresh_dates in published_reporting_direct_care for column documentation.
